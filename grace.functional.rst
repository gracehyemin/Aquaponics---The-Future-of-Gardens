[Aquaponics – The Future of Gardens]
==============

[In aquaponics, maintaining the levels of several variables are necessary to ensure ideal plant yield. This project will focus on the hydroponics subsystem. Future additions may include the aquaculture part of the system.]

Personas
========

Personas are a tool used to contextualize user and acceptance stories and aid
in the communication of product requirements.

[Gia]
--------------

[The Gardener]

Details
^^^^^^^

[Spends free time tending to garden with a less than satisfactory yield. Interested in creating an aquaponics system where one is able to gauge various conditions. Wants to automate system to increase efficiency and decrease need for constant adjustment in water levels, temperature, sunlight, pH, percentage of oxygen reaching roots, rate of water flow, etc.]

Goals
^^^^^

[Regular and precise measurements of conditions will ensure better quality crop yield in minimal space. Timed readings will allow him to know what to adjust and the system will also make needed adjustments.]

Problem Scenarios
=================

Problem scenarios are in-depth descriptions of situations particular
`Personas`_ would like to to improve. Effective problem scenarios describe the
problem at hand, the current alternatives or workarounds the user may employ
and the related value proposition.

[Insufficient Data Collection]
-----------------------

[Gia does not have regularly recorded readings of various conditions that she can access to figure out the cause of low plant yield.]

Current Alternatives
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[She records data by hand in the various conditions on a somewhat irregular basis. Without enough data, Bill finds it difficult to known exactly when to adjust variables ideally.]

Value Proposition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[Attaching sensors to measure the data and gathering recording in one place. Any irregularities will be notified to Gia through a text. In case of immediate attention required, the code will have a section to adjust levels accordingly. For example, a pH out of the required range for the soil will trigger an immediate response to decrease the water flow, until Gia approves further necessary adjustments.]

User Stories
============

A user story is a structured way of capturing a functional requirement from the
perspective of a specific user. User stories provide the context, intention,
and business case for each newly developed feature.

[Create equilibrium]
------------

As Gia the Gardener, I want to access regularly recorded data to know when and what is not within normal levels for several variables that directly influence the plants’ health so that necessary changes can be made immediately.
